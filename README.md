# 09-Juicy-Breakout
I added to my existing breakout game by adding different elements to it.
I added a two background songs that switch between each other.
I also added sound effects when the ball hits the tiles and a screen shake when the ball makes contact with anything.
Finally, I added a song when you get a gameover.
